									<!--<h3 class="major">Summary</h3>-->

									<p>Originally from East Kilbride in Scotland, Graham graduated from the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/">University of Glasgow</a> with an MSci (Hons.) degree in Physics and Astronomy in 2012. He then obtained his PhD in Astrophysics from the University of Glasgow's <a href="https://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/">Astronomy and Astrophysics group</a> in 2017, supervised by <a href="https://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/?p=123">Prof. Lyndsay Fletcher</a>. The topic of his PhD was <a href="https://theses.gla.ac.uk/7895/"><em>"Observations and modelling of the chromosphere during solar flares"</em></a>. In his thesis he explored the characeristics of energy and radiation transport through the solar atmosphere, including exploring the white light solar flares, chromspheric spectroscopy, and the role of Alfven waves in flares. Upon completion of his PhD, Graham became a <a href="https://npp.usra.edu/">NASA Postdoctoral Program</a> (NPP) Fellow at NASA's <a href="https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/heliophysics/">Goddard Space Flight Center</a> in 2017, advised by <a href="https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sed/bio/joel.c.allred">Dr. Joel Allred</a> on the modelling of solar flares. During this fellowship, he continued research into understanding the energy, radiation, and mass transport during of solar flares, with an emphasis on exploring how we can improve the ways in which he model flares and perform model-data comparisons. After the conclusion of his NPP Fellowship, Graham was appointed as a Research Scientist at the <a href="https://physics.catholic.edu/">Catholic University of America</a>. In this role he continues to be based at NASA GSFC as a co-operative scientist, funded via several NASA grants and the PHaSER co-operative agreement. His current reseach is focussed on how models might explain recent observations, where they cannot, and where we need to improve those models based on the constraints of observations.

</p>
									<p> Graham is an expert in the study of the solar atmosphere's response to solar flares, achieved via state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamical modelling of the solar atmosphere and the analysis of data from <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/missions/index.html">NASA observatories</a>. He has published over a dozen papers in peer-reviewed journals, has been invited to present his research at both national and international conferences, and has been awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in NASA funding (including an Early Career Investigator Program grant). He is a member of the science team for the MUSE Heliophysics MIDEX mission, scheduled for launch in 2027, and the ESCAPE mission concept being proposed as an Astrophysics SMEX mission. Graham has been a member of several <a href="https://www.issibern.ch/">International Space Science Institute (ISSI)</a> research teams, and currently co-leads an ISSI team with Vanessa Polito on the comparison of solar flare models.</p>
									
									<p> In addition to his research Graham enjoys public outreach of science, and is eager to explore new opportunities in that area. He is also actively involved in DEIA initiatives through his membership on the GSFC LGBTQ Advisory Committee and as a co-officer for NGAPS+, and is keen to continue educating himself on DEI issues and solutions.
