									<h3 class="major">Summary</h3>

									<p>Originally from East Kilbride in Scotland, Graham graduated from the University of Glasgow with an MSci (Hons.) degree in Physics and Astronomy in 2012. He then obtained his PhD, also from the University of Glasgow, in 2017, supervised by Prof Lyndsay Fletcher. The topic of his PhD was <em>"Observations and modelling of the chromosphere during solar flares"</em>, which focussed on the characterisics of the solar chromosphere during flares. Upon completion of his PhD, Graham became a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow at Goddard Space Flight Center in 2017, working with Dr. Joel Allred on the modelling of solar flares. During this fellowship, he continued research into understanding the energy, radiation, and mass transport during of solar flares, with an emphasis on exploring the need for energy transport mechanisms beyond the standard flare model. This research is achieved via state-of-the-art radiation hydrodynamical modelling of the solar atmosphere and the analysis of data from NASA observatories. After the conclusion of the NPP Fellowship, Graham was appointed as a Research Associate through the Catholic University of America. In this role he continues to be based at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

</p>
									<p> Graham is an expert in the study of the solar atmosphere's response to solar flares, has published over a dozen papers in peer-reviewed journals, has been invited to present his research at both national and international conferences, and has been awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in NASA funding (including an Early Career Investigator Program grant). He was a Co-I on the FIERCE mission concept for the most 2019 NASA Heliophysics Midex solicitation, and is a member of the science team for the MUSE mission concept currently in Phase A study. Graham has been a member of several International Space Science Institute (ISSI) research teams, and currently co-leads an ISSI team with Vanessa Polito on the comparison of solar flare models.</p>
									
									<p> In addition to his research Graham enjoys public outreach of science, and is eager to explore new opportunities in that area. He is also actively involved in DEI initiatives through his membership on the GSFC LGBTQ Advisory Committee, and is keen to continue educating himself on DEI issues and solutions.
